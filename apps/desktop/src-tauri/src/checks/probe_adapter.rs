//! Desktop reqwest adapter for portable engine probe outcomes.
//!
//! Every typed `ProbeRequest` passes through here, so this is also where the
//! transport is kept honest for the origin and for the verdicts: at most
//! `PROBE_HOST_CONCURRENCY` probe requests are in flight to one origin at a
//! time, and a request that failed at the connection level before any
//! response arrived is retried once inside its own timeout budget.
//!
//! Six checks still call `reqwest` directly instead of building a
//! `ProbeRequest`, and `guardrail-probe-seam.test.mjs` holds the list to those
//! six so the next check cannot quietly add a seventh. None of them can
//! reproduce the burst this seam exists to prevent: `probes.rs` walks its
//! sitemap candidates one await at a time; `performance/compression.rs`,
//! `performance/assets/measure.rs` and `polish/css_fetch.rs` read the bodies
//! they ask for, which is what returns the HTTP/2 frame budget the burst
//! exhausted; `performance/timing.rs` measures TTFB and must not have seam
//! queueing counted into the number it reports; and
//! `security/vulnerable_libraries.rs` queries the OSV API, not the scanned
//! origin.
